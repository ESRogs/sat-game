# Main Termination Theorem

Establishes the central result: **formula operations always terminate**.

## Theorem Hierarchy

1. **operation_decreases_literalCount**: Each valid operation on a nonterminal formula 
   strictly decreases the literal count
2. **HasLowerLiteralCount_wellFounded**: The literal count ordering is well-founded 
   (no infinite descending chains)
3. **operations_bounded_by_literalCount**: Any sequence of valid operations is bounded 
   by the initial literal count

Together, these theorems prove that sequences of formula operations must terminate.

/--
Relation defining when one formula has strictly fewer literals than another.

This serves as our termination measure: every valid operation on a nonterminal
formula produces a formula with a lower literal count, and natural number ordering
is well-founded.
-/
def HasLowerLiteralCount {Var : Type} : Formula Var → Formula Var → Prop :=
  InvImage (· < ·) Formula.countLiterals

/--
The literal count relation is well-founded.

This establishes that there are no infinite descending chains of formulas under 
the literal count ordering. This technical property is used to prove that 
sequences of operations must terminate.

/--
**Master Termination Result**: Every valid operation decreases literal count.

This theorem unifies all termination proofs, showing that regardless of which
operation is applied (variable assignment or clause removal), the literal count
strictly decreases for any nonterminal formula.

-- Strategy-Based Termination: Any valid strategy reaches terminal within literal count bound

Result of applying a strategy to a formula.
Either the formula is terminal (game over) or we get an operation to continue.
This avoids dependent types in the recursion by making the strategy handle the branching.

inductive StrategyResult (Var : Type) [DecidableEq Var] (f : Formula Var) where

/-- 
A strategy is a function that returns a result for any formula.
The result either proves the formula is terminal or provides a valid operation.
This captures the game-theoretic notion of "how to play" while avoiding dependent type issues.

def Strategy (Var : Type) [DecidableEq Var] :=

A strategy is well-formed if it respects the terminal/nonterminal distinction:

- Returns Continue when formula is nonterminal

Apply a strategy iteratively for n steps, stopping early if the formula becomes terminal.
This models playing a game according to a strategy until either terminal state or step limit.
With the new StrategyResult type, there's no dependent if-then-else!

**Core Iteration Shift Lemma**: The mathematical heart of the termination proof.

If a formula f takes one step to become g via a strategy, and g terminates within n steps,
then f terminates within n+1 steps. This connects the well-founded induction hypothesis
to the main goal without dependent type complications.
